# AstroBin's Space-Object-Alias-Map (SOAM)
I provided a comprehensive synonym file to AstroBin that can be used with Elasticsearch / Haystack to recognize multiple space object identifiers (aliases) as descriptors of the same space object (i.e. searching "M1" will return found text "Crab Nebula", because "M1" is the Messier catalog ID for the "Crab Nebula"... see https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-1/ for more info on this example, see https://github.com/astrobin/astrobin for a look at the synonym file destination, see https://app.astrobin.com/explore/iotd-tp-archive#iotd to try out the AstroBin site's image search feature.)
