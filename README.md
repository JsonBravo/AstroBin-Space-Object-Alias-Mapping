# AstroBin's Space-Object-Alias-Map (SOAM)
I provided a comprehensive synonym file to AstroBin that can be used with Elasticsearch / Haystack to recognize multiple space object identifiers (aliases) as descriptors of the same space object (i.e. searching "M1" will return found text "Crab Nebula")
(See https://github.com/astrobin/astrobin for destination details)
